# 2. Navigating Files and Directories

---

# Introduction

- The part of the OS responsible for managing files and directories is called the **file system**
- It organizes our data into:
	- File: hold information
	- Directories (aka folders): hold files or other directories 

---

# Preparation Magic

If you type the command:
> `PS1='$ '`
> into your shell, followed by pressing the 'enter' key,
> your window should look like our example in this lesson.  
> This isn't necessary to follow along (in fact, your prompt may have
> other helpful information you want to know about).  This is up to you!  


~~~
$
~~~


The dollar sign is a **prompt**, which shows us that the shell is waiting for input;
your shell may use a different character as a prompt and may add information before
the prompt. When typing commands, either from these lessons or from other sources,
do not type the prompt, only the commands that follow it.

---

# Who am I?

Type the command `whoami`,
then press the Enter key (sometimes marked Return) to send the command to the shell.
The command's output is the ID of the current user,
i.e.,
it shows us who the shell thinks we are:

~~~
$ whoami
~~~


~~~
nelle
~~~


---

# Who am I?

More specifically, when we type `whoami` the shell:

1.  finds a program called `whoami`,
2.  runs that program,
3.  displays that program's output, then
4.  displays a new prompt to tell us that it's ready for more commands.

Recall:

- The heart of a CLI is a **read-evaluate-print loop**, or REPL

---

# Unknown commands

- Shell is a program that runs other programs
- Commands you type must be the names of existing programs
- If you try to execute a program that does not exist, you will see an error like this:

> ~~~
> $ mycommand
> ~~~
> 
> 
> ~~~
> -bash: mycommand: command not found
> ~~~
> 
> 
> The Shell (Bash) tells you that it cannot find the program `mycommand`
> because the program you are trying to run does not exist on your computer.
> We will touch quite a few commands in the course of this tutorial, but there
> are actually many more than we can cover here.


---

# Where am I?

Next,
let's find out where we are by running a command called `pwd`
(which stands for "print working directory").
At any moment,
our **current working directory**
is our current default directory,
i.e.,
the directory that the computer assumes we want to run commands in
unless we explicitly specify something else.
Here,
the computer's response is `/Users/nelle`,
which is Nelle's **home directory**:

~~~
$ pwd
~~~


~~~
/Users/nelle
~~~


---

# The home directory

To understand what a "home directory" is,
let's have a look at how the file system as a whole is organized.  For the
sake of example, we'll be
illustrating the filesystem on our scientist Nelle's computer.  After this
illustration, you'll be learning commands to explore your own filesystem,
which will be constructed in a similar way, but not be exactly identical.  

On Nelle's computer, the filesystem looks like this:

![The File System](../fig/filesystem.svg)

At the top is the **root directory**
that holds everything else.
We refer to it using a slash character `/` on its own;
this is the leading slash in `/Users/nelle`.

---

# The root directory

Inside the root directory are several other directories:
`bin` (which is where some built-in programs are stored),
`data` (for miscellaneous data files),
`Users` (where users' personal directories are located),
`tmp` (for temporary files that don't need to be stored long-term),
and so on.

We know that our current working directory `/Users/nelle` is stored inside `/Users`
because `/Users` is the first part of its name.
Similarly,
we know that `/Users` is stored inside the root directory `/`
because its name begins with `/`.

---

# Slashes

> Notice that there are two meanings for the `/` character.
> When it appears at the front of a file or directory name,
> it refers to the root directory. When it appears *inside* a name,
> it's just a separator.


Underneath `/Users`,
we find one directory for each user with an account on Nelle's machine,
her colleagues the Mummy and Wolfman.  

![Home Directories](../fig/home-directories.svg)

---

# Listing

Now let's learn the command that will let us see the contents of our
own filesystem.  We can see what's in our home directory by running `ls`,
which stands for "listing":

~~~
$ ls
~~~


~~~
Applications Documents    Library      Music        Public
Desktop      Downloads    Movies       Pictures
~~~


`ls` prints the names of the files and directories in the current directory in
alphabetical order,
arranged neatly into columns.

---

# Listing with flags

We can make its output more comprehensible by using the **flag** `-F`,
which tells `ls` to add a trailing `/` to the names of directories:

~~~
$ ls -F
~~~


~~~
Applications/ Documents/    Library/      Music/        Public/
Desktop/      Downloads/    Movies/       Pictures/
~~~


---

# Getting help

`ls` has lots of other options. To find out what they are, we can type:

~~~
$ ls --help
~~~


Many bash commands, and programs that people have written that can be
run from within bash, support a `--help` flag to display more
information on how to use the commands or programs.

---

# Unsupported comand-line options

> If you try to use an option that is not supported, `ls` and other programs
> will print an error message similar to this:
>
> ~~~
> $ ls -j
> ~~~
> 
> 
> ~~~
> ls: invalid option -- 'j'
> Try 'ls --help' for more information.
> ~~~
> 


---

# Read the manual

For more information on how to use `ls` we can type `man ls`.
`man` is the Unix "manual" command:
it prints a description of a command and its options,
and (if you're lucky) provides a few examples of how to use it.

> ## `man` and Git for Windows
>
> The bash shell provided by Git for Windows does not
> support the `man` command. Doing a web search for
> `unix man page COMMAND` (e.g. `unix man page grep`)
> provides links to numerous copies of the Unix manual
> pages online.
> For example, GNU provides links to its
> [manuals](http://www.gnu.org/manual/manual.html):
> these include [grep](http://www.gnu.org/software/grep/manual/),
> and the
> [core GNU utilities](http://www.gnu.org/software/coreutils/manual/coreutils.html),
> which covers many commands introduced within this lesson.


To navigate through the `man` pages,
you may use the up and down arrow keys to move line-by-line,
or try the "b" and spacebar keys to skip up and down by full page.
Quit the `man` pages by typing "q".

---

# Parameters vs. Arguments

> According to [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parameter_(computer_programming)#Parameters_and_arguments),
> the terms **argument** and **parameter**
> mean slightly different things.
> In practice,
> however,
> most people use them interchangeably or inconsistently,
> so we will too.


We can also use `ls` to see the contents of a different directory.  Let's take a
look at our `Desktop` directory by running `ls -F Desktop`,
i.e.,
the command `ls` with the **arguments** `-F` and `Desktop`.
The second argument --- the one *without* a leading dash --- tells `ls` that
we want a listing of something other than our current working directory:

~~~
$ ls -F Desktop
~~~


~~~
data-shell/
~~~


---

# Looking at the contents of a directory

Now that we know the `data-shell` directory is located on our Desktop, we
can do two things.  

First, we can look at its contents, using the same strategy as before, passing
a directory name to `ls`:

~~~
$ ls -F Desktop/data-shell
~~~


~~~
creatures/          molecules/          notes.txt           solar.pdf
data/               north-pacific-gyre/ pizza.cfg           writing/
~~~


---

# Navigation by changing directories

The command to change locations is `cd` followed by a
directory name to change our working directory.
`cd` stands for "change directory",
which is a bit misleading:
the command doesn't change the directory,
it changes the shell's idea of what directory we are in.

Let's say we want to move to the `data` directory we saw above.  We can
use the following series of commands to get there:

~~~
$ cd Desktop
$ cd data-shell
$ cd data
~~~


These commands will move us from our home directory onto our Desktop, then into
the `data-shell` directory, then into the `data` directory.  `cd` doesn't print anything,
but if we run `pwd` after it, we can see that we are now
in `/Users/nelle/Desktop/data-shell/data`.
If we run `ls` without arguments now,
it lists the contents of `/Users/nelle/Desktop/data-shell/data`,
because that's where we now are:

---

# Where am I now?

~~~
$ pwd
~~~


~~~
/Users/nelle/Desktop/data-shell/data
~~~


~~~
$ ls -F
~~~


~~~
amino-acids.txt   elements/     pdb/	        salmon.txt
animals.txt       morse.txt     planets.txt     sunspot.txt
~~~


---

# How do we go back up?

We now know how to go down the directory tree, but
how do we go up?  We might try the following:

~~~
cd data-shell
~~~


~~~
-bash: cd: data-shell: No such file or directory
~~~


But we get an error!  Why is this?  

With our methods so far,
`cd` can only see sub-directories inside your current directory.  There are
different ways to see directories above your current location; we'll start
with the simplest. 

---

# Going back up

There is a shortcut in the shell to move up one directory level
that looks like this:

~~~
$ cd ..
~~~


`..` is a special directory name meaning
"the directory containing this one",
or more succinctly,
the **parent** of the current directory.
Sure enough,
if we run `pwd` after running `cd ..`, we're back in `/Users/nelle/Desktop/data-shell`:

~~~
$ pwd
~~~


~~~
/Users/nelle/Desktop/data-shell
~~~


The special directory `..` doesn't usually show up when we run `ls`.  If we want
to display it, we can give `ls` the `-a` flag:

---

# Show me everything with all

~~~
$ ls -F -a
~~~


~~~
./                  creatures/          notes.txt
../                 data/               pizza.cfg
.bash_profile       molecules/          solar.pdf
Desktop/            north-pacific-gyre/ writing/
~~~


`-a` stands for "show all";
it forces `ls` to show us file and directory names that begin with `.`,
such as `..` (which, if we're in `/Users/nelle`, refers to the `/Users` directory)
As you can see,
it also displays another special directory that's just called `.`,
which means "the current working directory".
It may seem redundant to have a name for it,
but we'll see some uses for it soon.

Note that in most command line tools, multiple parameters can be combined 
with a single `-` and no spaces between the parameters: `ls -F -a` is 
equivalent to `ls -Fa`.

> ## Other Hidden Files
>
> In addition to the hidden directories `..` and `.`, you may also see a file

# Orthogonality

# Going home

These then, are the basic commands for navigating the filesystem on your computer:
`pwd`, `ls` and `cd`.  Let's explore some variations on those commands.  What happens
if you type `cd` on its own, without giving
a directory?  

~~~
$ cd
~~~


How can you check what happened?  `pwd` gives us the answer!  

~~~
$ pwd
~~~


~~~
/Users/nelle
~~~


It turns out that `cd` without an argument will return you to your home directory,
which is great if you've gotten lost in your own filesystem.

---

# Quickly navigating directories

Let's try returning to the `data` directory from before.  Last time, we used
three commands, but we can actually string together the list of directories
to move to `data` in one step:

~~~
$ cd Desktop/data-shell/data
~~~


Check that we've moved to the right place by running `pwd` and `ls -F`  

If we want to move up one level from the data directory, we could use `cd ..`.  But
there is another way to move to any directory, regardless of your
current location. 

---

# Relative vs. Absolute Paths

- So far we have been using **relative paths**.  
    - When you use a relative path with a command it tries to find that location from where we are
- it is possible to specify the **absolute path** to a directory by including its entire path from the root directory
    - This is indicated by a leading slash.  `/` 

~~~
$ pwd
~~~


~~~
/Users/nelle/Desktop/data-shell/data
~~~


~~~
$ cd /Users/nelle/Desktop/data-shell
~~~


Run `pwd` and `ls -F` to ensure that we're in the directory we expect.

---

# Two More Shortcuts

> The shell interprets the character `~` (tilde) at the start of a path to
> mean "the current user's home directory". For example, if Nelle's home
> directory is `/Users/nelle`, then `~/data` is equivalent to
> `/Users/nelle/data`. This only works if it is the first character in the
> path: `here/there/~/elsewhere` is *not* `here/there/Users/nelle/elsewhere`.
>
> Another shortcut is the `-` (dash) character.  `cd` will translate `-` into
> *the previous directory I was in*, which is faster than having to remember,
> then type, the full path.  This is a *very* efficient way of moving back

# Nelle's Pipeline: Organizing Files

Knowing just this much about files and directories,
Nelle is ready to organize the files that the protein assay machine will create.
First,
she creates a directory called `north-pacific-gyre`
(to remind herself where the data came from).
Inside that,
she creates a directory called `2012-07-03`,
which is the date she started processing the samples.
She used to use names like `conference-paper` and `revised-results`,
but she found them hard to understand after a couple of years.
(The final straw was when she found herself creating
a directory called `revised-revised-results-3`.)

---

# Sorting Output

> Nelle names her directories "year-month-day",
> with leading zeroes for months and days,
> because the shell displays file and directory names in alphabetical order.
> If she used month names,
> December would come before July;
> if she didn't use leading zeroes,
> November ('11') would come before July ('7'). Similarly, putting the year first
> means that June 2012 will come before June 2013.


---

# Excessive typing

Each of her physical samples is labelled according to her lab's convention
with a unique ten-character ID,
such as "NENE01729A".
This is what she used in her collection log
to record the location, time, depth, and other characteristics of the sample,
so she decides to use it as part of each data file's name.
Since the assay machine's output is plain text,
she will call her files `NENE01729A.txt`, `NENE01812A.txt`, and so on.
All 1520 files will go into the same directory.

Now in her current directory `data-shell`,
Nelle can see what files she has using the command:

~~~
$ ls north-pacific-gyre/2012-07-03/
~~~


---

# Tab Completion

This is a lot to type,
but she can let the shell do most of the work through what is called **tab completion**.
If she types:

~~~
$ ls nor
~~~


and then presses tab (the tab key on her keyboard),
the shell automatically completes the directory name for her:

~~~
$ ls north-pacific-gyre/
~~~


If she presses tab again,
Bash will add `2012-07-03/` to the command,
since it's the only possible completion.
Pressing tab again does nothing,
since there are 19 possibilities;
pressing tab twice brings up a list of all the files,
and so on.
This is called **tab completion**,
and we will see it in many other tools as we go on.
